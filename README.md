## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://apixa25.github.io/steven-sills-portfolio/)

This is my ‚ÄúSteven Sills II‚Äù personal coding project portfolio. The reason I made this was so that I could show off my professional coding work product.   

If you go through my portfolio, you will see that I am new to professional level coding but my education is very structured and organized.  I created this work product while attending the Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp.  Something you will also see is that I was coding Crypto Utility Tokens 10 years before it was cool to even think about Crypto Utility tokens!  

## Learning Points 

Building this portfolio also displays my skill at HTML and CSS as it was built WITHOUT the use of graphic user tools.  It was all done directly in VS Code.  This is to show my understanding of HTML and CSS. I don‚Äôt need an editor to work with HTML and CSS.  This allows me an insane amount of freedom instead of being bound to some fixed options of a web editor.
